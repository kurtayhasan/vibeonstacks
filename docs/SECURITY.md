# Security Checklist - Simple Registry

This checklist highlights security considerations for auditing `main-contract.clar`.

- Access control: verify owner-only modifiers on update, transfer, delete functions.
- Admin controls: `set-paused` should be admin-only. Admin should be a multisig in production.
- Input validation: keys and values enforce length via string-ascii types.
- Reentrancy: Clarity is transactional and atomic; avoid external calls in state-changing flows where possible.
- Event logging: events emitted via `print` for off-chain indexing.
- Gas & performance: maps and owner-key lists designed to keep per-owner key indexing efficient; avoid O(n^2) loops.
- Backup & recovery: off-chain indexer should listen to events to reconstruct state for UIs.
- Upgradeability: to change logic, deploy a new contract and migrate state.

Recommended hardening:
- Use a timelock for admin-sensitive operations.
- Use a multisig for `admin` role.
- Add rate-limiting or quotas per address if needed.
- Write fuzz tests to detect edge cases.
